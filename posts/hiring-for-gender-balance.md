Recently I attended a webinar by [Work180](https://au.work180.co/) titled. “Hiring for a gender balance – job advert training”. Here’s a recap of the rough notes I took.

### Tips for job advertisements

- Do not require every skill under the sun. Have a maximum of 5 requirements (in dot point form). It should be a job advertisement, not a description. Market out to that talent.
- Share how your flexible working policy and parental leave works
- Use gender neutral language. A great free tool for this is [Gender Decoder](http://gender-decoder.katmatfield.com/). Masculine words include things like independent, lead, competitive, assertive, determined, analytical and feminine words include things like responsible, connect, dedicated, support, sociable, collaborative.
- Need to replace some of the masculine words with more feminine words. Have a balance of both. It’s recommend to use more feminine words if you’re in a male typical industry such as engineering.
- Describe the impact your company has instead of what you do in the ‘who we are’ section, as well as including the impact that person will have. Give them a reason to get passionate about the organisation.
- Share about career development programs, flexible work and leave if it’s better than others.
- Be more explicit about diversity at your company.
- Include employee testimonials but make sure it’s by someone in that particular role, not an HR person.
- Use ‘continue the conversation’ instead of apply now, to show that it’s a two way discussion, not a one way application.
- Set expectations – tell them when the application process closes, or if applications will be reviewed immediately, or steps in the application process.
- Use a combination of paragraphs & dot points.
- If using videos or photos, make sure you show different types of people. People need to see representation.
- Use real employee stories.

### Tips specifically for hiring women in male dominated industries

- Ask the women in your team what they think of your job ads, descriptions, etc.
- Female endorsement will encourage female applications.
- Need to be sharing on social media about the amazing women in your company and the opportunities they have.
- Have a strong employer brand – make sure people know why you’re a good place for women to work
- Women want to join companies that have a positive impact.
- Women want to know that they’ll be provided equal opportunity. You need to show that you’re a great place to work and show that they’ll have an impact.
