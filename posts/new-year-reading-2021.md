I set myself a goal to read 24 books in 2020.

I always had my nose in a book when I was young. As I got older and my focus shifted to my career, I prioritised study over reading. While still studying, I've also been working to return to my old reading habits. I'm focusing on development (personal, technical, and career) as well as fiction.

With the dumpster fire mess that was 2020, I ended up exceeding my goal by reading a total of 30 books. In 2021 I have increased my goal to 36. I have begun working on a 2021 Reading List in Notion that I will share later in this post. Skip to the end for important links! ðŸ™‚

First, to recap 2020, here are some of my favourite reads (or listens - some were audiobooks) from the past year:

### Reading plans for 2021

I have been using [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/) to track my reading progress in the past couple of years. It's a pretty terrible website though it does the job. There are few alternatives, unfortunately.

This year I wanted to plan my reading in advance, so I've used [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) to create a Reading List & tracker.

I haven't planned out the whole year as I'm sure new books or topics will come up that I haven't discovered yet. You can view the current state of my [2021 Reading List here](https://www.notion.so/2021-Reading-List-218f437e344e48019a628382c3f09334).

I modified the standard [Notion Reading List template](https://www.notion.so/Reading-List-14918425560f4ec5b303314a29eb53e1) to be more relevant to me. If you'd like to use this template you can duplicate either of these pages into your own Notion account.

If you're interested, I will be sharing my thoughts & reviews of these books on my [Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/taryn.codes/).
