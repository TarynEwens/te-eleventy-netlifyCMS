I wanted a break from my side project and thought I'd tweak the CSS of my personal site a bit for fun. Well, one full redesign later...

It's almost a whole new website! ðŸ˜„ Oops!

I've been feeling nostalgic lately for the good ol' days when I just had fun writing silly personal blogs on the internet. Back when there was no pressure for things to be perfect or to show off your technical skills.

Just pure fun. So with today's accidental "two hours later my website is totally different" coding adventure, I'm trying to take the pressure off this site. I might write more tech focused blogs. I might write some personal blogs. I might not write anything at all! 

If the last couple of years have taught me anything it's that I just need to go with the flow.
