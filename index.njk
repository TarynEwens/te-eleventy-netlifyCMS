    <p>Hello, Iâ€™m Taryn! ðŸ‘‹</p>
    <p>Iâ€™m currently working as a software engineer at Atlassian in Australia.</p>
    <p>Iâ€™m passionate about inclusion and that often translates to mentoring students and encouraging people to make career changes!</p>
    <p>This site is my little home on the internet. It changes regularly with my mood and may contain a mix of tech and personal stories.</p>
