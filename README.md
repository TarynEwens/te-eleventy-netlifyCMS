# Portfolio / Blog built with 11ty and Netlify CMS

The 2021 rebuild of my personal site, this time experimenting with Eleventy and Netlify CMS.

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/118fb410-66ed-4fda-a4cd-66613f40b762/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/angry-minsky-813079/deploys)

It's an updated version of my portfolio site on [www.tarynewens.com](https://www.tarynewens.com) but this time it's built in 11ty and Netlify CMS. Includes an updated design.

This previous version used NextJS. And before that it was a headless Wordpress CMS with a Gatsby front-end.

## How to develop

- `yarn eleventy --serve` to serve a development version of the site to localhost with hot reloading
