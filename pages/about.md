<p>I'm most passionate about mentoring junior developers and about diversity, equality and inclusion in the tech industry. </p>

<p>I love to improve user experiences for customers, but most of all enjoy working within highly collaborative teams who value openness and empathy. </p>

<p>In my experience, fostering an environment where individuals feel empowered to share their ideas freely not only enhances creativity but also leads to innovative solutions. I firmly believe that diversity in perspectives drives better outcomes, and I am committed to advocating for inclusive practices that celebrate differences and promote equity.</p>

<p>If you believe my background and expertise could benefit your team, I'm always open to new opportunities. Feel free to reach out via <a href="mailto:hello@tarynewens.com">email</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tarynewens/">LinkedIn</a> - I'd welcome the chance to speak with you!</p>

  <h3 className={utilStyles.h3}>Things I‚Äôve worked on</h3>
  <h4>Atlassian</h4>
  
  <ul className={utilStyles.listStandard}>
    <li>Part of the founding "Editor AI" team that delivered the frontend for the <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/artificial-intelligence">Atlassian Cloud Editors Generative AI</a> features. We went from concept to delivering general availability in less than a year, with private and public beta releases along the way.</li>
    <li>Organised team events which resulted in a team wellness survey showing that both individual wellbeing and team connectedness both increased to 100% (a 49% increase since the survey prior).</li>
    <li>In a project team of two, solved a key pain point by addressing a 15 year old customer request regarding the flexibility to restart the numbering in an ordered list at a different number. This resulted in roughly 1.6m 'restart lists' inserted per month and an estimate of 250k monthly active users in both Jira & Confluence.</li>
    <li>Contributed to a performance project which cut down time to interactive by 35%</li>
    <li>Coordinated the end-to-end releases of packages from platform into products, juggling up to 6 releases at a time at various stages from development to adoption. At the same time contributed to improvements in the release process & tooling.</li>
