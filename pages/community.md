    <h3>The Purpose Project</h3>
    <p>
      At the end of 2021 I was able to participate in
      <a

      >
        The Purpose Project

    <h3>STEM x Play</h3>
    <p>
      In 2021 I volunteered with

        href="https://www.uts.edu.au/about/faculty-engineering-and-information-technology/women-engineering-and-it/primary-and-high-school-programs/stem-x-play-primary-school-program"
      >

      </a>
      . I had the pleasure of joining a primary school class as an
      industry professional mentor. The aim is to increase young girls
      interest, confidence and identity with STEM and is incredibly
      rewarding to be part of.

    <h3 className={utilStyles.h3}>General Assembly</h3>
    <p>
      I'm regularly involved in the General Assembly software engineering
      community. I often make time for mentoring sessions with individual
      students, as well as other career changers.

      Sydney (and Melbourne once or twice!). I introduce them to CSS, the
      amazing things that can be created with it (think fun interactions
      and art!), and resources for them to continue learning more!
